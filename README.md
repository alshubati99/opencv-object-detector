# Building Object Detection Software.
## This program only detects persons and cell phones

### I have implemented this with [This Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUoWTPaKUi4&t=559s)


1. Capture from web cam.
2. Download `pysource.com/download/crash_course_ods.zip` for the trained model.
3. Dataset is in `classes.txt`.
4. For deployment I downloaded this library `pip install cx_freeze`
5. To run the program `program.py`
